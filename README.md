# PC Optimization Guide & Settings Collection

## Overview
Welcome to my PC settings and optimization collection! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to various tweaks and optimizations I've tested and implemented. While these settings work well on my system, they should be used as guidelines rather than direct copy-paste solutions.

## Repository Structure
- `/memory/` - RAM timing configurations and stability tests
- `/bios/` - BIOS settings and configurations
- `/windows/` - Windows optimization tweaks
- `/benchmarks/` - Performance results and comparisons

## Purpose
This repository aims to:
- Share tested and stable PC optimization settings
- Provide a reference point for others looking to optimize their systems
- Document successful configurations for future reference
- Help others understand the impact of various settings

## Using This Guide
1. Review the settings in each section
2. Understand what each change does
3. Test changes individually
4. Monitor system stability
5. Adjust based on your specific hardware

## Safety Precautions
- Always backup important data before making changes
- Implement changes one at a time
- Monitor temperatures and system stability
- Keep track of your original settings
- Have a plan to revert changes if needed

## Contributing
Your contributions are welcome! If you have:
