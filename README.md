# PC Optimization Guide & Settings Collection

## Overview
The goal of this repository is for me to have a collection of my pc settings as well as record modifications as time progresses. I will list my hardware and settings as well as issues and resolutions in hopes that this is archived and helps folks that stumble upon this on the internet. The goal for my pc is low latency and stability.

## Repository Structure
- `/benchmarks/` - Performance results and comparisons
- `/bios/` - BIOS settings and configurations
- `/clients/` - pc's that aren't my own I helped tune.
- `/issues` -  list of issues i've encountered and resolutions
- `/memory/` - RAM timing configurations and stability tests
- `/research` - research items, open to discuss and just writing out my self learning
- `/windows/` - Windows optimization tweaks
- `/tools/` - list of tools I use for benchmarking and troubleshooting
